# Candle-Handle-Scaled 1.0.0

1. The tool for search of good assets to buy/sell, which considers ONLY historical prices. It should find **good entry points**, not good investments.

2. This tool uses **Financial Modeling Prep API**. You need your own FMP API key to use CH Scaled.

3. You can use CH Scaled both for US stocks or crypto, doesn't matter. However, FMP API is made mainly for stock market, data for crypto there has lower quality.

4. CH Scaled shows final score + ticker as output. This final score evaluates how good asset is to consider to long-term buy or sell. Also it prints some useful data. Currently you can choose what to print only by changing the code of our tool (but it should be easy).

5. Scaled version makes it's search out of **ticker list**. That list may be really large, but we prefer lists of about 100 hundred assets (3 of them are in "tickers" file). You are free to change ticker lists anyhow.

6. Candle-Handle-Scaled may be improved by fine-tune of it's parameters. It should be a great area to work on. We are also going to add some new features later.

7. **Don't make any trading decisions considering only evaluations of this platform.** It WON'T make you rich. It was made only to help traders in their work as a useful tool.

8. *Be careful on financial markets. All losses there is your own responsibility!*
